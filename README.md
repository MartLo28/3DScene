## Project: Basic PC Setup in 3D Scene

### Overview
This project showcases a 3D scene featuring a basic PC setup. The scene includes a monitor, a speaker, a mouse, and a mouse pad. The main goal of this project was to practice creating and displaying a 3D environment while learning the basics of computational graphics.

## Reflection

### How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I start by breaking the project into smaller tasks. For this scene, I planned which objects to include and how they would be arranged. Then, I worked on building each piece step by step.

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to learn?
This project helped me learn how to structure objects in a 3D space and focus on details like proportions and positioning. These skills were useful for this project, but I might not apply them much in future work.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed a simple design process: planning the objects, creating each one individually, and testing how they fit together in the scene. This step-by-step approach kept the project organized and manageable.

### How do I approach developing programs?
I approach development by starting small and building up gradually. For this project, I created one object at a time and tested it before combining it with the others.

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I focused on keeping things simple at first and refining them later. Iteration played a key role in making the scene look balanced and realistic.

### How did iteration factor into your development?
I adjusted the size and position of the objects multiple times to ensure they looked good together. This trial-and-error approach helped me improve the final result.

### How has your approach to developing code changed while working on this project?
This project taught me the value of testing and refining each part before moving on. This is a practice I plan to use in future projects, even outside of 3D graphics.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science provides skills and tools that can be applied in many areas, even if not directly related to 3D graphics. It helps me develop problem-solving abilities and techniques that are useful for my career goals.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be used in your education?
This project gave me a better understanding of how to represent objects in a digital space. While I may not use 3D modeling often, it helped me practice creativity and problem-solving.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be used in your career?
Even though I do not plan to work with 3D graphics professionally, learning these skills gave me insight into how digital environments are built. This knowledge could be helpful for understanding related technologies in the future.
