## Project: Basic PC Setup in 3D Scene

### Overview
This project shows a 3D scene of a basic PC setup. It includes a monitor, a speaker, a mouse, and a mouse pad. The goal was to learn how to create and display a 3D world. While it was a good experience, I probably will not use these skills in the future.

## Reflection

### How do I approach designing software?
I start by figuring out what needs to be done and breaking it into small tasks. For this project, I thought about the objects I wanted to include and where to place them to look like a PC setup.

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to learn?
I learned how to think about organizing objects and paying attention to small details in 3D. Even though I learned these skills, I do not think I will use them much in the future.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?
I started by deciding what objects to make and how they should look together. Then, I worked on each object one at a time and made changes along the way.

### How could tactics from your design approach be used in future work?
Breaking things into smaller steps and improving them as I go can help with other projects, even if they are not about 3D design.

### How do I approach developing programs?
I usually start small and add more details over time. For this project, I created each object one by one and tested them before putting everything together.

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I kept things simple at first, making sure each object worked well before adding more detail. This worked for the project, but I do not think I will use this process much in the future.

### How did iteration factor into your development?
I changed the size and position of the objects, like the monitor and mouse, several times to make sure everything fit together nicely.

### How has your approach to developing code changed while working on this project?
I learned to work in a more organized way by testing each part before moving on. Even though I will not do more 3D projects, this is a good habit for other programming work.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Even though I do not plan to use 3D graphics, computer science helps me learn useful skills I can use in other areas, like IT and systems development.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be used in your education?
This project taught me how to represent real objects in 3D. While I do not expect to use this skill much, it helped me practice problem-solving and creativity.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be used in your career?
I probably will not use these skills in my career since I do not plan to work in areas like game design or 3D modeling. But it was good to learn how these tools can be helpful for other people.
